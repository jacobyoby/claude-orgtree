  catalog and its operational boundaries.

## Historical and exploratory records

[`history/PLAN.md`](history/PLAN.md),
[`history/feature-docket.md`](history/feature-docket.md),
[`history/interim-docket.md`](history/interim-docket.md),
[`history/HANDOVER-multi-account.md`](history/HANDOVER-multi-account.md), `mobile-spec.md`,
and the files in `attic/` preserve design history,
accepted work, or exploratory reasoning. They are not the source of truth for
current runtime behavior. Verify a claim in source and then update the
appropriate current guide or decision entry.
