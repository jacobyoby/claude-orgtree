# Typing wave — plan and status

User green-light 2026-07-31: introduce type annotations to the Python backend and
migrate the frontend to TypeScript, incrementally. This document is the ratified
scope; check items off as they land.

**What this wave is NOT** (assessed and rejected 2026-07-31):
- No async rewrite of the backend. The synchronous, threaded supervisor is a
  deliberate design around subprocess lifecycles and `DOC_LOCK`; FastAPI runs
  sync endpoints in a threadpool, and at this tool's scale an async supervisor
  would be the highest-risk change for the least gain. `.then()` chains in React
  event handlers are idiomatic and stay.
- No behavior change of any kind. Every step in this wave must be inert at
  runtime — annotations, config, and mechanical file conversion only. Anything
  that would change behavior gets its own commit outside the wave.

## Phase 1 — Python annotations (backend)

- [x] `backend/orgtree/schema.py`: `TypedDict` definitions for the org document
      — the JSON persisted per org (`~/orgtree/orgs/<slug>.json`) whose shapes
      previously lived only in people's heads (see the misleading-reads history).
      Single source of truth; extend it rather than re-deriving dict shapes.
- [x] `pyrightconfig.json` (basic mode, py3.10). Run with `npx pyright` from the
      repo root. Wired into CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml` — `npx --yes pyright`
      step, gates both matrix jobs). `backend/tests` is excluded on purpose: the
      suite deliberately passes wrong shapes to assert `LedgerError`, and its
      correctness gate is running it (`python backend/tests/test_ledger.py`),
      not checking it.
- [x] Annotate signatures across `ledger.py`, `store.py`, `supervisor.py`,
      `api.py`, and the small modules (`mcptool`, `sandbox`, `externtool`,
      `steer`, `subproxy`). Signatures and module-level constants first; locals
      only where inference fails. `dict[str, Any]` is acceptable where a shape
      is genuinely open — never guess a narrower type than the code proves.
- [x] Gate: `npx pyright` reports no errors in basic mode, and
      `backend/tests/test_ledger.py` passes untouched.

## Phase 2 — TypeScript, seam first (frontend)

- [x] `tsconfig.json` (strict, `allowJs`, `noEmit`) + `typescript` devDependency.
      Vite compiles TS natively; `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) is the gate
      — `vite build` does not typecheck.
- [x] `src/types.ts`: interfaces mirroring `schema.py`'s projection types — the
      tree payload, chat, inbox, org list. The API seam is where silent shape
      drift between backend and frontend actually bites.
- [x] `src/api.js` → `src/api.ts` with typed request/response signatures.
- [x] Convert leaf files: `forms`, `icons`, `picker`, `main`, `DiskBrowser`.
- [x] Convert `App.jsx` (runtime equivalence proven by esbuild-stripped diff).
- [x] Convert `Canvas.jsx` LAST (converted in place, NOT split — the user's
      strict-conversion directive superseded the split-as-it-converts idea;
      splitting remains available as pure-refactor follow-up work).
- [x] `allowJs: false` — nothing unconverted can hide.
- [x] STRICT no-`any` sweep (user directive 2026-08-01): zero type-position
      `any` in the frontend outside exception-handler error params; the one
      wire-boundary cast lives in api.ts `req<T>()`, and JSON.parse /
      localStorage sites carry stated-shape casts only.

## Phase 3 — tighten (optional, needs its own green light)

- [ ] pyright strict mode module-by-module. **Current state** (2026-09-08):
      Several modules carry `# pyright: strict` headers with per-rule
      suppressions for rules whose annotation backlog has not been paid down.
      Strict-opt-in files and their suppressed rules:
      - `api.py` — `reportUnknownMemberType`, `reportUntypedFunctionDecorator`,
        `reportUnknownVariableType`, `reportUnknownParameterType`,
        `reportUnknownArgumentType`, `reportMissingImports` (~454 sites)
      - `geminirun.py`, `codexrun.py`, `codex_limits.py`, `providers.py` —
        `reportUnknownMemberType`, `reportUnknownArgumentType`,
        `reportUnknownVariableType`
      - `ledger.py` — `reportUnknownVariableType`, `reportUnknownMemberType`,
        `reportUnknownArgumentType`
      - `net.py` — `reportUnknownMemberType`, `reportUnknownVariableType`,
        `reportMissingImports`
      - `store.py` — `reportUnknownVariableType`
      The Phase-3 work is to remove these suppressions one rule at a time by
      adding type annotations at each call site.
- [ ] `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in tsconfig.
- [x] Split Canvas.tsx into modules (canvas/{shared,modals,mail,desk,cards,
      OrgCanvas} + a 21-line barrel; verbatim-move verified line-by-line,
      minified bundle byte-count identical).
- [ ] Shared codegen for the seam types (schema.py → types.ts) if drift ever
      bites in practice; hand-mirrored until then.
