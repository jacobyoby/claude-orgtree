"""Persistence, concurrency and durability suite — store.py and disk.py, adversarially.

    An org document survives every way the process can be interrupted, every
    interleaving of readers and writers, and every hostile slug — or it says
    so loudly. It never half-exists, never silently loses a write, and
    nothing outside orgs/ is ever touched.

Run:  .venv/Scripts/python.exe backend/tests/test_persistence.py
      --quick        shorter concurrency runs (CI-ish; the default is ~35 s)
      --soak N       seconds per concurrency configuration (default 2.5)
      --only <sub>   run only sections whose name contains <sub>

No pytest (it is not installed here), no network, no model calls, no Docker.
Everything runs against a throwaway ORGTREE_DATA under the system temp dir.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
store.py is 150 lines and carries the whole durability story: one JSON doc per
org, DOC_LOCK, atomic tmp+os.replace, delete-as-rename into <data>/deleted/.
Read-only endpoints deliberately read OUTSIDE the doc lock (№22), so on
Windows every read races every write at the filesystem level — and Windows
fails `os.replace` while ANY handle on the destination is open. Both sides
carried a retry-with-backoff written on the belief that this is a brief
collision. Measurement says otherwise, and §1 is the measurement.

THE HEADLINE MEASUREMENT (2026-08-04, this machine, before the fix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
With 8 reader threads looping on `open()` and 1 writer:

    os.replace succeeded    0 / 1,659 attempts   (0.00 %)
    at 4 readers / 4 writers:  18 / 8,467        (0.21 %)

Not a race the writer sometimes loses — a starvation it essentially always
loses. A FILE_SHARE_DELETE read handle does not help (MoveFileEx opens the
target exclusively itself; check `share-delete handle does not rescue the
replace` below). The 20-step, 1.9 s backoff therefore only delays the raise:
under a 16-reader storm `save_org` raised PermissionError on 2 of 8 writes
and leaked a stray .tmp for each. §1 asserts the post-fix behaviour and the
pre-fix numbers are recorded here so a regression is recognisable.
