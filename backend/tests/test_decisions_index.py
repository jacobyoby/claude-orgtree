"""The register's index: numbers unique, citations resolvable — the acceptance suite.

`DECISIONS.md` is a normative register whose entries are addressed BY NUMBER,
and roughly twenty places in `ledger.py`, `supervisor.py`, `api.py` and the
test tree cite those numbers. Nothing checked that the numbers were unique.
They were not: `D-100`, `D-101`, `D-102` and `D-103` were each carried by TWO
different rulings at once (found 2026-08-26), so every citation of them
pointed at two entries and the reader had no way to tell which. Repaired by
giving the displaced entry a fresh number — the one the CODE cites keeps the
original, to minimise how many load-bearing citations move.

The register went four duplicates deep with nobody noticing, which is the
whole argument for this file: **an absent check and a check that cannot fail
are the same thing** (D-158). So neither section here is content to observe
that today's tree is clean. Each one seeds the real fault and watches the
checker report it.

    §1  entry numbers are unique — proved by seeding a real duplicate
    §2  every citation resolves to an entry — proved by seeding a dangling one
    §3  the 2026-08-26 repair, pinned
    §4  the citation form this suite recognises, and why it is not wider
    §5  naming a file on another drive must not crash the report

⚠ WHAT §2 CANNOT FAIL ON, stated because a green run must not be read as more
than it is. §2 proves every citation resolves to an entry that EXISTS. It says
nothing about whether that entry is the one the citation MEANT. A citation
pointing at a real-but-wrong ruling is a semantic error, it resolves perfectly,
and no cheap check will find it. This is not hypothetical: repairing the
duplicate numbers left four citations — `ledger.py`'s org-defaults comment,
`modals.tsx`'s mode field, two in `types.ts` — reading `D-100` while plainly
describing `D-101`'s ruling, and the duplication had been hiding it. They were
resolved by a human reading them (coordinator, 2026-08-26), which is the only
instrument that works on this class. Do not add a check that guesses.

⚠ §4 IS LOAD-BEARING, not decoration. `D-NNN` (three digits, zero-padded) is
`DECISIONS.md`'s namespace. `D-NN` (one or two digits) is
`docs/history/interim-docket.md`'s OWN, older series — its `## D-39` is
"`--expose-admin` — a command-line-only way off loopback", while this
register's `### D-039` is "unrecoverable holds its seat", a different ruling
entirely, and around sixty such short references are live in the tree.
Widening the pattern to `\\d{1,3}` would therefore not make this check
stricter; it would make it fail on day one against perfectly good history.
