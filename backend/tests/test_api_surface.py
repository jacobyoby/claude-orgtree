"""HTTP-surface adversarial suite — every endpoint and all three listeners.

    python backend/tests/test_api_surface.py        (no pytest; plain asserts)

WHAT THIS TESTS AND WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS

api.py serves one FastAPI app behind three wrappers with three trust levels:
the ADMIN app (loopback, no auth of any kind — "you can reach 127.0.0.1" IS
the credential), the PublicGateway (`/k/<token>`, an internet-facing kiosk
visitor), and the BridgeGateway (the one door out of a sandbox container,
gated by the org's secret). The security model is that those three cannot leak
into each other, so most of this file is isolation rather than happy paths.

⚠ Requests are made by calling the ASGI app DIRECTLY with a hand-built scope,
not through an HTTP client. That is deliberate: httpx/requests normalise a URL
before it goes on the wire, so `..`, `//`, `%2f` and case games never reach the
gateway — and the gateway is what they are aimed at. A hand-built scope is
exactly what uvicorn hands the app after decoding the request target, so this
delivers what an attacker can really deliver. §11 then puts a REAL uvicorn on
port 7402 and speaks raw HTTP to it, which is what proves the assumption the
rest of the file rests on (that percent-decoding happens below us).

Nothing here spawns a turn, a container or a CLI. ORGTREE_DATA is a throwaway
temp dir (org docs are re-slugified from name, so a shared data dir makes the
fixtures collide), chatq registration and sandbox warm-up are stubbed so the
suite never touches ~/.claude/chatq or Docker, and every fixture org is created
through the API so the create path is covered too.

Two checks assert a KNOWN GAP rather than a fix — they are labelled ⚑ and each
says in its body what should happen the day the gap is closed.

    §1  fixtures + the public token gate
    §2  the public restriction matrix (frozen vs open)
    §3  path tricks against the matrix
    §4  cross-org isolation
    §5  secrets never leave loopback
    §6  error scrubbing for public visitors
    §7  the sandbox bridge
    §8  /api/agent — the MCP gateway
    §9  uploads, scratch and path traversal (+ §9b the org-disk browser)
    §10 failure modes — nothing 500s
    §11 raw HTTP against a real uvicorn on :7402

      had "credential rejected — replace it, then resume" overwritten with a
