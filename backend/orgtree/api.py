    ⚠ THE STAMPED NUMBER DESCRIBES A ROSTER THAT MAY NO LONGER EXIST.
    `frozen.until` / `until_ts` are written ONCE, at freeze time, from the
    account that hit the wall (supervisor, the `_ensure_frozen` block). Add a
    key, remove one, or reorder them and nothing writes them again — user
    report 2026-08-26: "the refresh time doesn't adapt to account changes or
    keys being added / removed". The record is the supervisor's to stamp, so
    the only honest place to CORRECT it is where it is read.

    ⚠ IT REPORTS CAPACITY, NEVER A WAKE — and that is the deeper half of the
    same bug. The old wording promised "resumes <time>", which is false on
    any org with `auto_resume` OFF (the default): nothing wakes the node when
    capacity returns, the operator does. User ruling 2026-08-26 — "off means
    off" — so a second account appearing is not consent nobody gave. This
    says what the ROSTER supports and leaves resuming to ▶.

    ⚠ THREE STATES, AND THE THIRD IS THE POINT. When no account carries a
    real refresh time there is NO T — an auth freeze marks no lane by design
    — and computing a plausible-looking countdown for it is exactly the
    invented-T failure the expired-login rule exists to prevent. It says the
    time is unknown instead. It also never SHORTENS a mark: it reads the
    marks rather than recomputing a horizon, so it inherits the pool `max()`
    floor by construction.

    Scope is deliberately narrow — a pure `limit` freeze that is not
    `limit_locked`. A connection freeze owns its own timer and both consumers
    render it down a separate branch; a fable weekly lock is not a
    subscription-pool question and `resolve` cannot describe it.

    `cache` memoises per tier for the life of ONE tree render: `resolve`
    re-reads the roster file per call, and a large org would otherwise pay
    that once per frozen node (the O(n²) warning above is already watching

    used to do in the calls AFTER `orgtree_hire` / `orgtree_rehire`: the
    retool-only scope fields, the audience grants, and the kickoff that
    actually starts the seat.

    User request 2026-08-27: hiring one agent took four calls (hire, retool,
    audience grant, kickoff message), and between them the seat exists but is
    not yet the agent that was described — a hire left at the org's default
    permission mode cannot act at all in a headless turn. Rehiring one took
    five, the extra being a rename.

    THREE PROPERTIES, in the order they matter.

    1. KICKOFF IS LAST, structurally rather than by convention. Nothing here
       starts a turn: `_notify` only queues (it never wakes, §7.4) and
       `mail_notify` is a UI animation signal with no state on it. The ONE
       wake path is `drive`, which `agent_call` consumes AFTER `store.save_org`
       and outside DOC_LOCK. So the seat's mode, scope and audiences are all
       persisted before its first turn can possibly begin. `audience_grant`
       wants to drive the grantee itself; we collect that instead of letting
       it through, and append the seat to `drive` exactly ONCE, here, at the
       tail — which also spares a fresh hire the pointless "Audience granted"
       wake the four-call version gave it.

    2. ALL-OR-NOTHING on partial failure. The caller is never told "hired"
       while quietly getting less than it asked for. This needs no new
       machinery: the whole dispatch already runs inside DOC_LOCK on an org
       freshly parsed from disk by `store.load_org`, and `store.save_org` is
       reached only if nothing raised. A bad audience target or an unknown
       folder in a later step therefore 422s with the failed step NAMED, and
       the node that `org.hire` created moments earlier is discarded with the
       unsaved doc — it never existed. Preferred over validating up front,
       which would mean a SECOND copy of each check sitting beside the real
       one, free to drift out of agreement with it.

    3. NO NEW AUTHORITY. Every step calls the same ledger method the
       standalone tool calls, with the same `actor` — `set_scope` for the
       scope fields (its own strict `_actor_cap` clamp caps permission_mode at
       the caller's own and refuses granting what the caller lacks),
       `audience_grant` for every target (which is also what makes 'user',
       a live peer and 'extern' the vocabulary here — it is that method's,
       not a second one invented for the shortcut), and `post_mail` for the
       kickoff. A shortcut that granted something the long way refuses would
       be a privilege escalation wearing a convenience's clothes.

        while still in flight. No clock is compared, only a string this
        process itself wrote.

        ⚠ The body is used RAW. `_mail_block` writes `f"…· {at}\\n{m['body']}"`

        durable one for the whole of the turn's first response (measured
        2026-08-04 on a real transcript sample: median 2.4 s, max 137 s). The
        composer trims, but nothing else does: the API takes `body.text` as
        sent, and agent mail routinely opens with a newline. Only the emptiness
        guard strips — and only where it must. With an `at` the marker is
        unique whatever the body is, so a whitespace-only message (nothing
        forbids one; only the composer trims) is identified like any other. It
        is only the legacy `at`-less entry that falls back to a bare body, and

    The override is an ENV VAR (user ruling 2026-08-04, superseding the

    detached process is the awkward path. Unattended hosts are the case that
    needs this, so the mechanism should suit them.

    handled elsewhere: env vars are INHERITED by child processes, so every
    agent CLI would see this one through `supervisor.clean_env()`. It is
    stripped there (it is not the agent's business whether the host is
    exposed) — see that function.
