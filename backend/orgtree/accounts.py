"""Machine-local account routing — WHERE each model's prompts go on this machine.

The user's 2026-08-25 redesign, replacing the D-144 registry/pin/selection
stack wholesale. Two facts and nothing else:

  · the key list       — the SECONDARY accounts this machine may bill, as
                         pasted `claude setup-token` keys, in priority order
  · usage_refreshes    — `[account][tier] = refresh-at | absent`, the TOTAL
                         routing state: an entry exists iff that account's
                         capacity for that tier is used up, and holds the
                         epoch when it refreshes

The PRIMARY account is not stored here at all: it is whoever Claude Code is
signed in as on this machine, read live from the CLI's own config. It is not
switchable from any UI — logging in/out with the CLI is the only mover.

Routing is per MODEL TIER and machine-global: a tier runs on the highest-
priority account (primary first, then keys in list order) whose capacity for
it is not used up. There is no per-org selection, no pin, no adopted-identity
registry — everything that was not this machine's own routing state is gone
(user ruling 2026-08-25: "all other state not related to this machine is to
be dropped from the internal system").

⚠ THE INVARIANT CARRIED OVER FROM THE OLD REGISTRY: **this file's document
stores IDENTITY AND STATE, never CREDENTIALS.** Key material lives in the
token store (`tokens.py`, its own file); `accounts.json` holds opaque row ids
(a short hash), account uuids, and timestamps. `_reject_secrets` still runs
on every write and raises rather than redacting.

A key row carries the `account_uuid` its token resolved to (one profile call
at registration, best-effort, lazily retried). It is IDENTITY for the panel to
display and nothing more.

⚠ DUPLICATE-OF-PRIMARY DETECTION IS GONE (user ruling 2026-08-25, second
ruling of the day, and it RETIRES the first). A key that resolved to the same
account as the login used to be excluded from routing and greyed in the panel,
because failing over to it re-spends the identical limit (measured live
2026-08-24 21:20Z: the re-driven turn hit the same session limit 4.2 s later).
The observation stands; the DETECTION does not. D-147 established that a
`claude setup-token` key is inference-only, and the profile endpoint wants the
same `user:profile` scope the usage endpoint does — so `account_uuid` never
resolves for a key registered from now on, and the check could only ever fire
for rows carried over from a v1 registry. A guard that fires for one row in a
hundred is worse than none: it makes the panel's behaviour unexplainable. Do
not reintroduce it without a way to learn a key's account that actually works.

    ⚠ THE MARK LANDS ON THE WHOLE POOL, not just the tier that hit the wall
    (user ruling 2026-08-25): haiku, sonnet and opus share one subscription
    bucket, so a sonnet limit on this account IS an opus limit on it. Before
    this, an opus turn would fail over correctly and the very next haiku turn
    would walk straight back into the same exhausted account, because its own
    tier carried no mark — one wasted spawn per sibling tier, every time.

    The mirror NEVER SHORTENS an existing mark: if a sibling is already parked
    later than `refresh_at`, that later time is the one still known to be
    true, and lowering it would hand back capacity nobody watched return.

    ⚠ AND FABLE RIDES ALONG WHEN IT HAS NOTHING OF ITS OWN (user feature
    2026-08-26, amending D-148 — see D-152). A limit on any NON-fable tier
    also parks THIS ACCOUNT's fable, at the same time, **but only when fable
    carries no live refresh time already**. Three properties, and each one is
    load-bearing:

      · ONE-DIRECTIONAL — a fable limit still spreads to nobody. Fable's own
        wall is weekly and says nothing about the subscription bucket.
      · ABSENT-ONLY, not `max()` like the pool mirror — a fable mark that is
        already there was put there by a real fable limit (or by an earlier
        ride-along), and it is neither raised nor lowered. This is also what
        makes the feature testable at all: an implementation that simply
        marked every tier in `TIERS` would be indistinguishable from this one
        without it.
      · PER-ACCOUNT — `usage_refreshes` is `[account][tier]`, so the account
        whose subscription ran out is the only one whose fable is parked.
        Parking fable everywhere because one account hit a wall would be a
        different (and wrong) feature.

    Nothing is BLOCKED by the extra mark: with every account marked,
    `_resolve_in` still names the soonest-refreshing one and a spawn goes
    there, re-marking itself if it fails. The cost of being wrong here is one
    probing spawn; the cost of being right is not burning a fable turn — the
    most expensive tier there is — on an account that has just proven it has
