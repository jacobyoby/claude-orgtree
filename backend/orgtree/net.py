"""@net: — the mail-hub client (F-06).

Two halves:
- IDENTITY (Phase A): the org's permanent network identity + hub config.
- TRANSPORT (Phase C): the spool sender + multiplexed long-poll daemon.

Identity model (docs/mailserver-spec.md §3, all user-ruled):
  secret      = secrets.token_hex(16)        minted BY the org at creation
  fingerprint = sha256(secret)               the hub stores only this
  slug        = f"{org}.{username}.{fingerprint[:6]}"   minted ONCE, persisted,
                never recomputed — the address survives moves and renames.

Transport model (spec §4/§10, all ruled): outbound sends return instantly by
writing a SPOOL entry into the org doc (staged inside the caller's DOC_LOCK,
riding the same save as the org-inbox row — no crash window where the ledger
says "queued" with no spool entry); the SENDER thread drains spools with
backoff and retries FOREVER ("no hub yet" is a status, not an error). The
POLLER thread holds one multiplexed long poll per hub address covering every
participating org; inbound mail is dedup'd against a persisted seen-ring,
DELIVERED FIRST (deliver_org_inbox = net_wake auto), recorded seen, then
ACKED — a crash between steps duplicates, never loses. Receipts are
best-effort and never block correspondence.

⚠ Secret hygiene: the secret lives in the org doc (`net_identity`) and is
returned by exactly one loopback-admin endpoint (`GET /api/orgs/{slug}/net`).
It must never enter a tree payload, an agent's context, a log line, or a URL —
on the wire it rides headers only. Kiosk orgs mint NO identity at all: they are
sealed from the outside world, and an identity that does not exist cannot leak
(stronger than filtering rosters).

⚠ Lock discipline: DOC_LOCK is never held across an HTTP call. The daemon
threads take it only to read/mutate docs, in the same order as everyone else.
