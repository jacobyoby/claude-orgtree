"""Session supervisor — turns ledger rows into real Claude Code sessions.

Attachment strategy is resume-on-demand (№3): no idle processes. A node is a session
UUID; each delivered message runs ONE turn via `claude -p` (first turn `--session-id`,
later `--resume`). Spike-verified flags (spike/FINDINGS.md):

  - prompt goes via STDIN (variadic flags swallow positional prompts)
  - full model ids only (aliases drift)
  - `--permission-mode acceptEdits` + `--add-dir <granted>` = autonomy within dirs (№5)
  - `--append-system-prompt` is honored on resume → identity regenerated every turn (№29);
    since 2026-08-17 it rides `--append-system-prompt-file` (a scratch dotfile, rewritten
    per spawn) — a big org chart on argv blew Windows' 32,767-char CreateProcess cap
    ([WinError 206], which is the command-line limit despite its filename wording)
  - `--settings {"disableAllHooks":true}` + `--strict-mcp-config` isolate the node from
    the user's global hooks and MCP servers
  - node cwd must live OUTSIDE ~/.claude → scratch under the data root

Runtime state (busy flags, queues) is in-memory only; the ledger stays the source of
truth for live/archived. A server restart loses in-flight turns, never ledger state.

      (loopback 401 + fabricated key, no real credential): the code arrives on
      `{"type":"system","subtype":"api_retry","error":"authentication_failed"}`
      — one event per retry, streamed live, BEFORE any outcome.
    · SEEN IN THE TRANSCRIPT FILE ONLY, from the real incident: a synthetic
      assistant message with `isApiErrorMessage: true` carrying the same
      `error` field plus the human sentence. I have NOT confirmed that carrier
      in the stream, so this reads BOTH and neither is load-bearing alone.
    Do not collapse the two on the assumption they are the same event — a
    branch written against the assistant message alone was the shape that
    would have matched nothing, silently, and it was only caught by measuring.

    1. **NEVER assign this back onto `err_blob`.** `err_blob` is the input to

       blast radius (what every agent's failures classify as) and is
       deliberately NOT this change. Call this AT the recording site, so the
       widened text never exists as a variable a later edit could feed to a
       classifier by accident.
    2. **NEVER feed this to `_turn_abandoned`.** That function puts the text
       into MAIL to the failing agent and drives its SUPERIOR. Auth-failure
       text delivered as mail is the specific thing that has repeatedly
       destroyed fable-tier sessions on this machine — the trigger is the
       SUBJECT, not any secret. The abandonment mail keeps the narrow blob.
    3. **NEVER CREATE a record.** An empty `err_blob` means "no failure" (a
       manual ⏸ clears it); returning text for one would book a pause as a
       failure — the same trap `_name_the_cause` documents.

# wedged one):
# · TURN_IDLE — the watchdog: kill only after this long with ZERO CLI stdout
#   events. A hung CLI emits nothing; a productive one emits constantly, so
#   this distinguishes "wedged" from "working", which a wall-clock cannot.
# · TURN_TIMEOUT — the absolute ceiling per message (re-based at each result
#   event, "fresh budget per message"). A backstop, not the thing that fires.

TURN_IDLE = int(os.environ.get("ORGTREE_TURN_IDLE", "600"))          # seconds
# …but stdout silence only means "wedged" when NOTHING IS RUNNING. A
# backgrounded Task/Agent keeps working INSIDE this CLI process after the
# turn's own result event — the tool_result returns at once, the turn ends,
# orgtree closes stdin — and the parent's stream goes quiet while the subagent
# works. The flat idle rule read that healthy CLI as a corpse and SIGKILLed
# it at exactly TURN_IDLE, taking the subagent AND the completion notification
# the CLI had already queued for it (user bug 2026-08-20: two agents lost
# their redteam reviewers twice each and then waited forever on a
# notification that had died with the process; measured at 600.258s and
# 600.0s after the parent's last event — TURN_IDLE to a quarter second).
# While the CLI reports live background work, silence is the EXPECTED state
# and gets its own far longer ceiling. TURN_TIMEOUT still caps the whole turn,
# so a genuinely wedged process is still reaped, just not a busy one.
#
# ⚠ THE COST, stated plainly: `_run_one_turn` holds its `_turn_slots` seat and
# the node's `busy` flag until the process exits, so a node minding a live
# background child now stays busy for as long as the child runs — up to this
# ceiling instead of TURN_IDLE's ten minutes. Mail sent meanwhile QUEUES (it is
# durable in the mailbox and delivers on the next turn, so nothing is lost) and
# MAX_CONCURRENT seats are held longer. That is the honest reading of the
# state — the agent really is working — and the alternative was killing the
# work to free the seat. This number is what bounds it: raise it for
# longer-running subagents, lower it if seat pressure ever bites.
#
# FOLLOW-UP CANDIDATE, deliberately NOT done here (ruling 2026-08-20): the
# turn could RELEASE its `_turn_slots` seat once the boundary result has been
# read and only background children remain, since nothing after that point
# needs the concurrency budget. That is a restructure of the `with _turn_slots:`
# block spanning the whole turn — real risk on a delicate concurrency path, for
# a cost whose failure mode is LATENCY, not loss. Do it as its own targeted

    report 2026-08-10: "I ran a compaction on a headless agent with an API
    key and it said it hit the WEEKLY usage limit, as though it were still on
    a subscription"). The strip above is unconditional, and only the TURN
    spawn put the key back — so every OTHER `claude` this org starts ran with
    no key at all and fell through to the user's subscription. Three spawns
    exist (turn, compaction fork, oracle/consult fork) and every one routes
    through here.

    THE ACCOUNT LANE (user redesign 2026-08-25, machine-local): when the API
    key lane is not open, `tier` — the model tier this process will bill —
    picks the account. `accounts.resolve(tier)` walks primary-then-keys in
    panel order and answers with the highest-priority account whose capacity
    for that tier is not marked used-up. PRIMARY is the machine's own login:
    nothing is injected and the CLI reads its own credentials store; a key
    row injects `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. When no account has capacity the
    resolver names the one that refreshes soonest and the spawn probes it —
    a failed probe re-marks that account and costs one turn per refresh
    horizon, which is the honest price of asking. `tier=None` (watchdog
    shell checks) stays ambient: a process that bills no model needs no lane.

    ⚠ THE KEY LANE IS EXCLUSIVE. One spawn, one credential: an env carrying
    both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and an account token leaves "which lane billed
    this turn" to CLI internals nobody here controls, and every attribution
    and freeze decision downstream keys off the single injected credential
    (`identity_in_env` reads the resolved dict, never intent).

    ⚠ TOKEN INJECTION MUST STAY AFTER `clean_env()` AND IT IS NOT A STYLE
    POINT: `clean_env()` strips EVERY `CLAUDE_CODE_*` variable, so injecting
    before it is a SILENT NO-OP that looks exactly like a working feature
    (measured 2026-08-24: the pinned CLI 2.1.220 does read this variable).
    AND THE STRIP MUST NEVER BE RELAXED TO ACCOMMODATE THIS — it is why an
    ambient token in the BACKEND's environment cannot silently capture every
    org, the same failure a host-level API key once caused.

    Sandboxed orgs are excluded from BOTH lanes on purpose: their credential
    reaches the process through the container's own environment (sandbox.py),
    and setting it on the host-side `docker exec` would leak it into an
    argv/env the container does not own."""

    ⚠ THE ORG-ONLY QUESTION IS THE WRONG QUESTION AT A MULTI-PROVIDER BOOKING
    POINT, and this is the whole reason the function exists. `api_fallback`
    is an ANTHROPIC key: `spawn_env` injects it as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and
    `_bank_api_cost` accumulates what it billed onto `api_cost_usd`, which the
    canvas renders to the user as "subscription $X · api key $Y" with the
    subscription half derived as `total − api`. A dollar banked there wrongly
    corrupts BOTH halves of a number a person reads.

    A codex-tier process cannot bill that key, and not by accident: `codexrun`
    strips every `ANTHROPIC_*` and `CLAUDE_CODE_*` variable out of the child's
    environment on purpose (and `OPENAI_API_KEY` too, so the mirror mistake is
    equally impossible), and its dollars are priced by `providers.codex_cost`
    from OpenAI rates. Asking `api_fallback_active(org)` about such a process
    asks whether a credential window is open for a credential the process has
    been deliberately deprived of — the answer is real, and irrelevant.

    ⚠ THE AXIS IS POSITIVE — "is this a KNOWN Anthropic tier", not "is this
    not a known codex one". An unrecognised tier therefore reads as NOT
    billing the key, which is the safe direction for money: under-reporting

    REPORTED. This is the half where the CLI dies too hard to report it. The

    nothing to stderr and left `errors: []` empty, so orgtree synthesized
    "the CLI exited 1 without writing anything to stderr" (see the `err_blob`
    fallback) — which matches no errno spelling on earth. It fell through to

        nothing on stderr, `errors: []` empty. A nonzero exit carrying a real
        error is evidence, and evidence is never overridden here — those keep
        today's terminal behaviour, untouched.
    `started`    — a top-level assistant event arrived, so the CLI launched,
        reached the API, and got an answer out of it. This is the clause that
        excludes the failures which must NEVER retry: a bad argv, a missing
        CLI, an unreadable config, a charter too big to send. They die before
        the model ever speaks, so they stay terminal exactly as they do now.
    `not boundary` — no top-level result event ever arrived, so it died IN
        FLIGHT and not after finishing. A turn that reached its boundary and
        then exited nonzero is a straggler, not a casualty.

    Deliberately NOT a catch-all, for №28's reason and the one the classifier
    above already states: "retry any failure" turns a crash loop into an
    infinite one. The residual case this DOES admit is a CLI that genuinely
    crashes mid-response every time — and that is bounded by the very same
    NET_RETRY_MAX, off the very same `net_fail_run` counter, deliberately
    shared so a node flapping between the two classes gets four attempts in

    the user-message envelope instead of in the appended system prompt.

    ⚠ WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE SYSTEM PROMPT ANY MORE, because it will look like
    gratuitous indirection to whoever reads this next and it is not. Everything
    in here changes because some OTHER agent moved — was hired, retired,
    retooled, reallocated. The appended system prompt is rewritten before every
    spawn (see the `--append-system-prompt-file` site), and the Anthropic prompt
    cache is a strict PREFIX match with `system` ahead of `messages`. So one
    byte of drift in the system prompt discards the entire conversation cache
    and the agent re-pays its whole context.

    MEASURED, on this machine, before the split (cache-misses, 2026-08-29):
    one hire changed 6 of 8 live agents' system prompts, i.e. made six unrelated
    agents re-pay their full context on their next turn; an org-wide fable_lock
    toggle hit 8 of 8. Across 60 nodes / 1,441 resumes, 68% of all resumes were
    cold, and the cold rate tracked exactly how much org state a node rendered:
    org_visibility self 33% vs full 73%, and that gap survives a gap-length
    control (0% vs 55% cold at sub-60s gaps). 196.6M cache-creation tokens were
    written on cold resumes against 2.6M on warm ones.

    Riding the turn envelope costs this block's own tokens once and leaves the
    conversation prefix untouched. NOTHING WAS REMOVED — every line an agent
    used to read here it still reads, one position later in the request.

    ⚠ SO DO NOT MOVE ANY OF THIS BACK, and do not add a new live-org field to
    `identity_prompt` because it is "just one line". One line is all it takes;

                   rendered TWICE, once as the pending bubble and once as the
                   durable one, on every send to a busy agent.
      via="turn"   written to the CLI as a user event, so the transcript WILL
                   carry it — but not until the process has started and echoed
                   it back. That is D-29's "starting…" phase: ~1 s warm,
                   several seconds cold, longer still for a sandboxed org that
                   must start a container first. Draining removed it from the
                   mailbox at the top of the turn, so for the whole of that

    exactly the duplicate described above — but suppressed the row for the
    whole window INCLUDING the part where nothing else was showing it, and
    left the steer duplicate untouched. One test replaces both halves: the
    transcript actually having this mail. Superseded is not replaced, and
    replaced is not "will be replaced eventually" — evidence, both ways.

# ------------------------------------------------------- mail POINTER nudges
# A "ping" is a drive nudge whose entire content is *there is mail in your
# box, go and read it* — "(orgtree) You have new mail above…" and its
# siblings. It carries no information of its own, which is exactly what makes
# it droppable: if the box is empty when it lands, it says nothing at all.
#
# ⚠ THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (2026-08-28, user-reported "phantom wakes").
# One nudge is queued PER SEND, but `take_mail` drains the box WHOLESALE. So
# two messages arriving while a node is busy queue two pings; the first
# delivery renders "[MAIL — 2 message(s)]" and empties the box, and the second
# arrives pointing at nothing — a full agent turn whose entire user-side
# content is the banner. Measured in the coordinator's own transcript: a turn
# that answered two mails ("Two things landed") followed immediately by a bare
# banner, 0.1 s later, through the result-boundary feed.
#
# The counts disagree because they are counts of DIFFERENT things: banners are
# per-send, mail is per-box. THE FIX: a pointer that drains nothing is dropped
# at the moment of delivery — before the CLI is launched at a turn start,
# before the write at a result boundary, before the injection at a steer — so
# the wake never happens at all rather than happening quietly. A self-contained
# nudge (a replayed message, a restart notice) is never a ping, is never
# dropped, and still delivers against an empty box.
#
# ⚠ COALESCING WAS TRIED AND BACKED OUT. Collapsing a second pointer into the
# one already queued is the tidier-sounding "make them agree at the source",
# and it is redundant: the drop above already guarantees no phantom reaches an
# agent. What it cost was real — ordinary mail is how `deepqueue` builds a long
# queue, and that suite exists to prove the iterative drain does not wedge on
# one. A fix that quietly removes another suite's ability to reach the state it
# guards is worse than the duplication it saves.

    this session's prompt cache? (D-179, user request 2026-08-29.)

    ⚠ THIS IS NOT A NEW TRIGGER — IT IS A SECOND WAY TO BE COLD. Read
    `_auto_cheap_cfg` first: `idle_s` defaults to 3600 because that is the
    prompt-cache TTL, and its whole meaning is "past this, the resume is cold
    and the swap pays for itself". Idle time is a PROXY for coldness, not the
    thing itself. An account switch makes the cache cold at any idle time —
    the prompt cache is scoped to the account that wrote it, so the new
    account has never seen a byte of this session and the resume pays the full
    1.25×C cold-wake price (docs/cache-economics.md) no matter how recently
    the last turn ran. So this answers the SAME question `idle_s` answers, on
    the other axis, and it is OR-ed with it rather than added as a third bar.

    ⚠ AND WHY THE OCCUPANCY BAR IS NOT TOUCHED. `cheap_compact` is FREE — it
    makes no API call at all, it swaps `session_id` for a fresh uuid and
    archives the old session as a knowledge bearer (ledger.cheap_compact).
    There is no token cost to amortise and therefore no "did we get enough
    turns out of it" break-even. What a needless swap costs is CONTEXT, and
    the occupancy bar is the whole of what protects it. A switch says the
    reload is expensive; only occupancy says the session is big enough that
    losing it is the better trade. Both, always.

    ⚠ IT COMPARES TWO RESOLVED IDENTITIES, NEVER TWO INTENTS. `serving`
    returns `identity_in_env(spawn_env(...))` — the account the spawn will
    ACTUALLY authenticate as, api-key lane included — for the same reason
    `identity_in_env` takes an env dict at all (read its docstring). Asking
    `accounts.resolve` here instead would answer "where would this tier route
    now", which is a different question the moment an org bills its own key.

    ⚠ UNKNOWN ON EITHER SIDE IS NOT A SWITCH, and the asymmetry is deliberate.
    `_auto_cheap_cfg` states the direction: "a skipped compaction costs one
    cold reload, a needless one destroys a live session". A false NEGATIVE
    here is one cold wake; a false POSITIVE throws away a live agent's whole
    context. So this fires only when both sides are known AND attributed:
    an absent `ran_as` (the node has not run in this backend process), an
    empty answer from `serving`, or `key:unattributed` on either side — a
    token no row explains, which two consecutive turns could hold different
    values of — all read as "cannot tell", and cannot tell means do not.

    `serving is None` means the caller is not asking about accounts at all
    (every hermetic caller, and every test that predates this), and the
    answer is a plain False: the idle bar then decides alone, exactly as it

# ── D-142/a · THE DEPLOY KILL WINDOW ──────────────────────────────────────
# The mid-turn refusal that guards a deploy is consulted at T=0, but the kill
# lands MINUTES later, after pull + npm + build. An agent woken by mail inside
# that gap is started and then cut mid-turn — the very "turn dies, nobody is
# told" shape this branch exists to close, arriving from the outside.
#
# ⚠ WHY A HELD TURN AND NOT A REQUEUED ONE. The obvious design refuses the
# turn and puts its message back, which invents a new outcome —
# requeued-not-run — and every reviewer's first prediction was that it would
# lose mail. It does not have to exist. Mail is drained from the doc only AT
# DELIVERY, inside `_run_one_turn`; at `_run_turn`'s door nothing has been
# dequeued yet, and `busy` is already True so later messages queue normally
# and are drained when the turn really starts. So the turn is HELD at the
# threshold, not turned away: no mail moves, and a mail-loss bug is not
# possible rather than merely tested for.
#
# ⚠ AND WHY THE CLEAR IS UNCONDITIONAL, with no exit-code branch. Measured in
# update.ps1 on 2026-08-21, re-checked 2026-08-27: the point of no return is
# its `Stop-Process -Id $p -Force` call in the "restarting the backend"
# section, and EVERY failure exit precedes it. Only the two after the kill —
# the stale-pid refusal and "backend did not come up" — follow. So the
# tautology holds: this flag lives in the backend's own memory, and if the kill
# had landed we would not be here to clear anything. Being alive to watch the
# child die IS the proof that no restart happened to us. That same
# `Stop-Process` is wrapped in `catch {}` — a FAILED kill is silently swallowed
# (which is why the stale-pid check exists, the one that compares the listening
# pids before and after), so surviving our own deploy is a real path, and one
# that must readmit turns or every org on the machine wedges for good.
# Never gate on the exit code: `exit 0` is emitted by at least three
# NO-RESTART paths (the -EnsureUp no-op, mutex contention, and -OnlyIfBehind).
#
# ⚠ CITED BY ANCHOR, NOT BY LINE NUMBER, deliberately (D-168, 2026-08-27).
# This comment used to name specific lines in update.ps1 — `Stop-Process` at
# 278, the stale-pid check at 326, eleven numbered exits. They had already
# drifted (278 was 289, 326 was 335) with nobody the wiser, because a comment
# cannot fail a test. A citation that rots silently into a lie is worse than a
# vaguer one that stays true, so these name marker text that moves with the
# code. Do not re-pin them to numbers; that re-arms the same trap on a timer.
# The claim to re-verify, if update.ps1 changes, is the ORDERING — that no
# failure exit sits after the kill — not any count. D-142/a carries the count.

    The pardon says "this session id was minted and never handed to the CLI,

    spent the moment that stops being true, or №31 is disarmed for good on
    that node and a genuinely lost session comes back as silent amnesia — the
    node keeps its name, credits, team and mailbox, resumes with `--session-id`
    on an EMPTY session, and nobody is told (redteam finding 2026-08-18).

    Two things this does NOT do, both deliberate:

      * it does not spend on a COMPLETED turn (`_after_turn`). A turn that ran
        and then failed — usage-limit freeze, network freeze, timeout kill,
        the backend dying mid-turn — never reaches `_after_turn`, and the CLI
        has written the transcript regardless. Waiting for a clean turn left
        the pardon standing over a session that had demonstrably run.
      * it does not spend on a successful SPAWN either: a spawn that dies
        before the CLI writes anything would burn the pardon on a session that
        still never ran, which is the original bug again. The transcript on
        disk is the evidence; nothing else is.

    `sid` is the session the turn actually LAUNCHED on, and the node's current
    session is re-read and compared under the lock: `cheap_compact` has no
    in-flight guard (the user or a superior agent can mint mid-turn), and
    spending by node id alone ate the successor's fresh pardon.

            #    diagnosis added before this would make a PAUSE a failure.

    """A turn failed TERMINALLY — nothing will retry it and nothing will
    re-drive the node. Say so, once, to somebody who can act.

    This is the general case of the 2026-08-21 incident. `_retry_exhausted`
    below covers the class orgtree DOES retry; this covers the classes it
    deliberately does not: a turn killed by the idle watchdog or the turn
    budget, a CLI that died before the model ever spoke (a bad argv, a
    missing or downgraded CLI), an exit carrying a real error. Retrying any
    of those would be wrong — but the node is left `live`, unfrozen, with a
    `turn_error_log` row and NOTHING ELSE. From one level up that is
    indistinguishable from an agent quietly working, which is the whole harm.

    ⚠ THE FAILING AGENT IS NEVER DRIVEN, and that is the bound. `_retry_
    exhausted` could drive its node because a transient failure plausibly
    passes on the next attempt; here the opposite is true by construction.
    If the CLI cannot start, driving the agent spawns another CLI that
    cannot start — the agent never reads the mail, and the announcement
    becomes its own retry loop. So the agent gets DURABLE MAIL (read
    whenever it next runs, for whatever reason) and its SUPERIOR gets the
    DRIVE: a different node, a different session, a CLI that works. The
    self-trigger loop is not guarded against here — it is structurally
    impossible, which is the better of the two.

    Bounded by `hard_fail_run`, shared across every door: the caller
    announces only on the transition to 1, and only a COMPLETED turn clears
    it. N consecutive terminal failures produce ONE announcement, however
    many different ways they failed.

    `door` names HOW it died, because a superior reading this needs to know
    whether to look at the code, the machine, or the agent. Returns True if
    anyone was actually told — the caller logs the honest thing either way."""

    say so OUT LOUD, to the agent and to its superior (user incident
    2026-08-21, coordinator ruling the same day).

    Silence is the actual harm the incident did. The retry ceiling below was
    already honest in its own way — it wrote `_log_turn_error`, a durable row
    on the node's own record — but that row is read by opening the agent's
    chat, and the agent is idle and will never open anything, while its
    superior is told NOTHING AT ALL. So the failure was durable and
    invisible at the same time: indistinguishable, from one level up, from an
    agent quietly working. That is precisely how a live agent came to sit for
    two hours with uncommitted work while the only re-driver in the system
    was a human happening to look at a screenshot.

    Same shape as `_bg_orphaned`, deliberately — durable mail first (it must
    survive a backend restart, which is one of the ways this happens), then a
    nudge that actually DRIVES the turn, because a mailbox is not a wake.

    TWO recipients, for two different jobs:
      · the AGENT — it is the only party that can recover its own uncommitted
        work, and it is the one holding it. This is the recovery.
      · its SUPERIOR — so the chain learns without a human noticing. Driven
        EXACTLY ONCE, on final exhaustion only, never per attempt (the
        caller's `run == NET_RETRY_MAX + 1` guard): a retry that succeeds on
        attempt 2 must cost the superior nothing, and four attempts must not
        cost it four turns.

    A top-level node has no superior to tell; the user is its audience and
    the agent's own drive is what surfaces it. Never raises — this runs on a

    the difference between a LOST generation and a consultable knowledge
    bearer.

    The bug this exists for (measured 2026-08-20, ingame-prompt@6): the CLI's
    in-place compaction does not destroy anything. It APPENDS a
    compact_boundary, then the summary, then the post-compaction turns, all to
    the same file. But `record_cli_compaction` left `session_id` UNCHANGED, so
    the archived predecessor and its live successor named ONE session — and
    resuming it replays from the last boundary, i.e. the successor's own
    post-compaction state. Nothing was lost but the resumable HANDLE, and the
    generation was written off as unconsultable while its every record sat on
    disk.

    So: copy lines [0, upto) — everything above the boundary — verbatim to a
    fresh session id beside the original, and hand that to the bearer. A plain
    PREFIX is exactly right, and cheap:
      · resume replays from the file's LAST boundary, so cutting at boundary k
        leaves boundary k-1 last and the resumed context is precisely what the
        agent held the instant before boundary k fired (the k>1 case falls out
        for free — no special casing per generation);
      · a prefix of a valid parentUuid chain is a valid parentUuid chain, so
        no record rewriting is needed;
      · the CLI keys a session on the FILENAME and tolerates the stale
        `sessionId` inside the records — live-verified 2026-08-20 by resuming
        a hand-cut prefix under a new uuid: it loaded clean and held exactly
        the pre-cut context, and nothing else;
      · the bearer gets its OWN file, so it can never collide with the
        successor that is still appending to the original.
    This is the same shape `--fork-session` performs internally, which is how
    the §8 split path has always kept its bearers consultable.

    ⚠ This was an org-wide `max(every frozen node's until_ts)` gate until
    2026-08-10, and that starved short freezes (peer report, source-traced):
    ONE node parked on a long timer — a weekly fable limit hours or days out —
    held back auto-resume for every other frozen node in the same org,
    including a 30-second connection backoff. The org-wide shape was not
    arbitrary: `resume_frozen` un-freezes the WHOLE org, so waking early for
    one node would have un-parked the long-frozen one too. Both halves are
    fixed together — readiness is per node here, and the wake passes those
    nodes to `resume_frozen(only=…)` rather than sweeping the org.

    A node another mechanism owns (`_resumable` → None) is never "ready": it
    would be skipped by the resume it triggered, so counting it would re-fire
    the sweep every tick forever.

    Timed freezes wake at their own `until_ts`, plus a minute's grace for the
    LIMIT kind only — there the timestamp is the API's claim about someone
    else's clock and a hair early means re-freezing. A connection backoff is
    OUR OWN timer measured from our own failure; padding it just makes the
    node wait longer than the label it already showed the user.

    A limit/connection freeze with NO time known is probed on the 5-minute
    floor instead of waiting for a human forever (redteam gap 2026-08-05);
    that floor is org-wide (`auto_resume_last`), since a probe is a guess and
    guessing once per org per 5 minutes is enough.

    TWO THINGS THIS FUNCTION KNOWS THAT A TIMESTAMP CANNOT (D-156):

    · an auth freeze (`cause == "auth"`) is never ready. Its `until_ts` was
      priced as a wait, and a rejected credential is not waiting for
      anything; the timer would re-present it forever.
    · a freeze that parked on a DRY account pool becomes ready when the pool
      has capacity again, whatever its `until_ts` says. That timestamp
      described the old pool and nothing re-derives it when a key is added.
      Keyed on the freeze's OWN record of what the resolver said at the time

        that loses the volume strands every peer permanently: they believe
        they are registered, never re-register, and 401 forever);
      · port bindings and .env are never modified — a bind change is
        comms-substrate class (the news of its failure travels on the
        channel it broke) and stays a human decision;
      · NO automatic rollback in v1: a correct dead-man's switch needs the

# ── FR-27 · THE PRIMED RESTART ────────────────────────────────────────────
# User design, 2026-08-27, verbatim: "when executed, a restart will
# automatically occur the moment all agent turns have stopped and no pending
# turn-starting mail is in flight. this will both ensure a restart eventually
# happens, while also not interrupting any single agent's work."
#
# ⚠ WHAT WAS ACTUALLY BROKEN, because it decides the whole design.
# `orgtree_self_restart` was not misbehaving. Its mid-turn refusal is the
# precondition doing its job. What failed is the HUMAN-SHAPED half: the agent
# holding the intent kept deferring the call to "next wake", and was then
# cheap-compacted before making it — so a merged fix sat undeployed for a day
# with nobody holding the thread. An intent that lives only in one agent's
# head dies with that agent's session.
#
# ⇒ THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS MOST IS THAT ARMING OUTLIVES THE ARMING AGENT:
# its compaction, its retirement, its dissolution, and a backend bounce. A
# flag on a node, a field in an org doc keyed by the arming agent, or an
# in-process timer would each rebuild the original bug with more steps.
#
# ⚠ WHY A MACHINE-WIDE FILE AND NOT AN ORG DOC (the watchdog precedent).
# Watchdogs persist in `org.d["watchdogs"]` and `_wd_tick` re-attaches them at
# boot: "the doc is the registry, this loop is just its runtime attachment".
# That PRINCIPLE is copied exactly. The LOCATION is not, for two reasons that
# an org doc gets wrong:
#   · A restart is machine-wide. Priming from org A restarts org B too, so a
#     prime recorded in A's doc is invisible in B's UI — the indicator would
#     under-report to precisely the orgs about to be cut. Every org's tree
#     reads this one file, so every org's header says so.
#   · The user ruled priming IDEMPOTENT, and idempotency has to hold across a
#     bounce. One file is one fact: two orgs cannot each hold "the" prime, and
#     "is one already armed?" is a single read that a restart cannot forget.
# The file sits beside `self-restart-*.log` in the data root, which is where
# `launch_self_restart` already keeps its own machine-wide records.

    ⚠ THIS IS THE RACE CLOSE, and it is the reason `_working_locked` exists.
    Between "reads idle" and "the deploy child is actually spawned" there are
    milliseconds in which mail can wake somebody, and that turn would then be
    cut mid-flight — the exact harm `others_working`'s refusal exists to
    prevent, arriving through the automated door instead.
    What makes the window closable is that the two facts share ONE lock:
    `deliver()` sets `st["busy"] = True` under `_state_lock` and only THEN
    starts the `_run_turn` thread, and `_run_turn`'s first act is
    `_hold_for_deploy` — "the single choke point: all three thread starts
    target this function" (D-142/a). So, under `_state_lock`:
      · anyone already busy is visible to `_working_locked` → we refuse;
      · anyone who goes busy AFTER we clear `_deploy_done` reaches
        `_hold_for_deploy`, sees the cleared event and PARKS at the threshold
        with nothing dequeued and no mail moved.
    There is no third case. The window is not narrowed, it is closed.

    Returns [] when the machine was claimed, a busy list when it was not, and
    None when a deploy window is already open (someone else is deploying —
    ours must not adopt or later release their hold).

    ⚠ EVERY [] RETURN LEAVES A HOLD ON THE MACHINE when `hold` is true. The
    caller owns releasing it. `hold` is false for a mailhub-only prime on
    purpose: that leg rebuilds a container and never touches this backend, so

    A dog's authority was established once, at `watchdog_create`, and never
    looked at again. Two ways that went wrong, both measured:

      · the lifecycle ruling says an ARCHIVED owner PAUSES its dogs, but
        `watchdog_fire` was the only thing that could pause one — so the
        pause depended on the dog happening to fire. A stream dog whose

        with the org's key in its environment, for an owner that had been
        retired. Nothing would ever have stopped it.
      · `watchdog_create` refuses a command/stream dog to an owner without
        bash, and correctly still does — but revoking bash afterwards left
        the existing dog executing its command every interval. A capability
        that outlives its revocation is not a capability, it is a leak.
      · the same for a FILE dog's containment (measured 2026-08-12): the API
        boundary checks the target against the owner's readable roots at
        create time, and revoking the folder grant afterwards left the dog
        reading that folder and MAILING its contents to the owner. The
        confidentiality face of the same defect.

# `orgtree_wait` cap: externtool slices a wait at min(max(timeout_s,5),300),
# so a POLLING peer is never quiet for more than ~300s of its own accord (the

#

# detach breaks a working integration, and it is diagnosed from the FAR side

    reach no verdict from it (redteam finding 2026-08-18).

    `transcript_index` returns `{}` for two states reconcile cannot otherwise
    tell apart: "this store holds no transcripts" and "this store is not
    there". For a disk-migrated sandboxed org the second is the NORMAL state
    after a host reboot — the ext4 image is not loop-mounted until something
    asks for a container, and the startup sweep runs before anything does. A
    verdict from that empty index condemns EVERY live node in the org in one
    pass, and each one then refuses mail.

    Resolving the root can also raise outright (`disk.distro()` fails loud
    with `DiskError` when WSL is down), and the sweep's caller is a FastAPI
    startup handler with no guard around it: with Docker Desktop stopped, one
    disk-migrated org stopped the whole backend from starting.

    ⚠ Three verdicts, and the distinction between the last two is the
    whole point (redteam 2026-08-18). The walk itself decides — never a
    separate `isdir`, which answers False for an unreadable directory and
    True for one that cannot be LISTED (a root-owned `projects/` on an org
    disk; a transient 9p error over the \\wsl.localhost view), the second
    of which walks straight back into the empty-index condemnation:

      * PRESENT → the index, and №31 judges normally;
      * UNREADABLE (any OSError but ENOENT/ENOTDIR) → None. Present-but-
        unlistable is not evidence of anything;
      * NOT A DIRECTORY (ENOTDIR) → the store cannot be reached THROUGH
        that path, which is a verdict rather than a blind spot: `{}` for a
        host-backed org (see below), None for a sandboxed one;
      * MISSING (ENOENT) → None for a SANDBOXED org, whose transcripts sit
        on a disk image that is routinely not mounted yet; and for a
        host-backed org, `{}` only when the store is PROVABLY absent.
        Gone must still condemn — skipping the sweep would let a user who
        deleted their transcript store resume onto silent empty sessions
        instead of being told, which is the outcome №31 exists to prevent
        — but "gone" has to be proven, not inferred from the errno: on
        Windows a deleted `projects/`, a junction whose target is missing,
        an unmapped drive letter and an unreachable UNC share all raise the
        SAME FileNotFoundError, and three of those four mean "I could not
        look" (measured, redteam 2026-08-18 — the first draft justified

    This is the whole live/durable reconciliation, in ONE place that can see
    both sides. It used to run in the browser, once per mounted view, against
    a payload the client had assembled itself — matching by 300-character
    string prefix and expiring on a 5-second timer that raced the transcript
    write. Here a tool row retires on the CLI's own tool_use_id, and nothing
    is dropped on a clock: a row survives until its durable twin is visible.

    Sticky rows (immediate /context output) are in no transcript, ever, so
    they are never swept — only the turn's end clears them.

    ⚠ The match window is PER KIND, and that is the whole point of this
    block (redteam, 2026-08-12, on a report from the neoja org; measured: a
    20-step unwatched turn stranded 8 rows whose twins were all present).
    The sweep runs only inside `read_chat`, and the desk polls only while
    someone is looking — so a turn that ran unwatched presents its whole
    backlog at the first poll. Judging that backlog against a fixed 12-row
    tail retired the last handful and STRANDED the rest for the remainder of
    the turn: the sweep's quality must not depend on when a human happened to
    open the desk.
      · tool — the whole transcript. `tool_use_id` is globally unique, so a
        match IS the durable twin, and there is no false-retire to fear.
      · text — this TURN (everything after the last user row). Text has no
        id and is matched by its first 300 chars, so the window is not
        arbitrary caution: widening it to all of history would let a phrase
        the agent used yesterday retire today's live row. Per-turn is the
        largest window that cannot collide with history, and any strand
        inside it is bounded by the turn the row belongs to anyway.
      · thought — unchanged; it has neither id nor text and rides the
        ordering rule below.

    ⚠ THE CHRONOLOGY BACKSTOP (user report 2026-08-14: "temporary greyed out"
    rows render out of order — the desk draws the durable block first and the
    whole live tail below it, so a live row that outlives its on-screen twin
    sinks beneath events that happened after it). The CLI writes its
    transcript strictly in order, so a durable record NEWER than a live row
    is proof the row's own record is already written — its twin is on screen
    (or deliberately filtered), whatever the matching above concluded. Any
    non-sticky row older than the newest durable stamp minus 2 s therefore
    retires. This is not the old drop-on-a-clock timer (that one raced the
    transcript write with no evidence at all); the evidence here is ORDER,
    and the 2 s guard only absorbs the stamp jitter between a stream event's
    server-side `at` and the CLI's own record `ts` (same machine clock; the
    known hazard is a queued user message whose record cuts the line while
    an assistant message is still streaming). A strand now outlives its twin
    by one poll cycle, not the rest of the turn. Sticky rows are exempt: they

    output stays visible under the composer).

    №24 read it as "the LAST non-synthetic assistant record's usage wins", and
    a compaction breaks that rule: every record in the file describes the
    prompt as it was when that call was made, and after a compaction the
    newest of them describes a prompt that no longer exists. So a compacted
    agent kept REPORTING the context it had before — until its next turn
    appended a record of the new one (user bug 2026-08-20: an agent read 213k
    the moment its /compact finished and 58k after one trivial turn).

    A boundary therefore INVALIDATES the running figure, and what replaced the
    history stands in for it: the session's own floor (its smallest observed
    fill ≈ system prompt + tools) plus the surviving conversation. The estimate
    is MARKED, never dressed up as measured, and the first real record after
    the boundary supersedes it.

    Neither half is guesswork where the transcript can be asked. Measured over
    every compacted session on the machine that reported this bug (13 usable
    fixtures, 2026-08-20), against what the next turn went on to measure:

        floor + compactMetadata.postTokens   median  3%, worst  5%  (12 of 13)
        floor + len(summary) // 4            median 11%, worst 16%  (13 of 13)

    — against a pre-compaction reading that was 3.6x high (up to 12x). So
    postTokens is used when the CLI writes it and the character count is the
    fallback for the older record shape, which omits it. Both run LOW, which is
