"""Multi-org persistence (№36). One JSON file per org under the DATA root.

Data root is ~/orgtree (NOT ~/.claude — spike finding 4, and node scratch dirs live
beside the ledger data).

⚠ SPIKE FINDING 4, RESTATED 2026-08-07 (six measurements against the pinned CLI, after
it misled a diagnosis): the file tools do not "refuse" a ~/.claude path — they raise a
PERMISSION REQUEST ("… which is a sensitive file"). An interactive seat can answer it;
a HEADLESS turn has no approver, so it surfaces as a refusal. The distinction matters
because the gate is not a classifier you can satisfy: an Edit(//path/**) allow rule, an
explicit --add-dir on the path, --permission-mode dontAsk, and a PreToolUse hook
returning permissionDecision=allow were each measured and each still refused. The gate
sits ABOVE the allow-rule, add-dir and hook layers. Only --permission-mode
bypassPermissions clears it, and that bypasses every other check too (user ruling
2026-08-07: agents that want to write the global skills run bypassPermissions; nothing
is plumbed over the file tools to fake it).

Layout:

    ~/orgtree/
      orgs/<slug>.json          the ledger documents
      scratch/<slug>/<node>/    node working dirs (flat per §7.6; made by the supervisor)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the latch
# Windows: `os.replace` over the live doc fails with WinError 5 while ANY
# handle on the destination is open — and MoveFileEx opens the target
# EXCLUSIVELY itself, so no share-mode trick on the reader's side helps
# (measured: a reader holding a FILE_SHARE_DELETE handle blocks the replace
# exactly as a plain `open()` does). The retry-with-backoff below was written
# believing this was a brief collision. It is not: with 8 reader threads
# looping on `open()`, `os.replace` succeeded 0 times in 1,659 attempts
# (0.00%), and at 4R/4W 18 of 8,467 (0.2%). The writer does not lose a race,
# it never gets to run — the 1.9 s backoff budget just delays the raise.
#
# So readers and the replace are made not to OVERLAP, by the cheapest thing
# that achieves it: readers take this latch SHARED for the microseconds of
# the byte read only (they never block each other, and they still never take
# DOC_LOCK — №22's read-outside-the-lock property is untouched), and
# `save_org` takes it EXCLUSIVE across the single `os.replace`. JSON parsing
# happens after the handle is closed and the latch is dropped, so a slow
# parse costs a writer nothing.
#
# ⚠ Nothing that can call back into load_org/save_org may run while this is
# held — the held regions are one `read()` and one `os.replace()`, keep them
# that way. It is per-process only, like DOC_LOCK; the retry loops stay as
# the residual defence against another process (a backup agent, an on-access
# virus scanner) holding the doc open.

# ------------------------------------------------- one backend per data root
# MEASURED, 2026-08-04 (test_compaction.py "xproc"): two OS processes running
# the canonical `with DOC_LOCK: load_org → mutate → save_org` cycle against one
# org doc lose **32–74 % of their completed writes**, with **zero exceptions,
# zero torn reads and zero orphaned temp files**. Both guards above are
# per-process: `DOC_LOCK` is a `threading.RLock` and `_IOLatch` a `Condition`,
# and `os.replace` is atomic — which is exactly why the failure is invisible.
# Every writer is told it succeeded; the loser's changes are simply not there.
#
# Note what this does NOT justify: a cross-process lock around `save_org`
# alone would not help at all. The race is the read-modify-write CYCLE, so a
# correct lock would have to span `load_org … save_org`, i.e. replace
# `DOC_LOCK` in every caller — regions that spawn CLI children and can be held
# for the length of a 600 s compaction fork. That is a deadlock surface, not a
# fix.
#
# So the rule the architecture already states — ONE BACKEND PER DATA ROOT — is
# enforced at the one moment it is cheap and safe to enforce: process start.
# The claim is an OS-level file lock, not a PID file with a staleness
# heuristic. That distinction is load-bearing: a stale-lock STEAL based on
# mtime is independently broken against a merely-slow (not dead) holder —
# reproduced 2026-08-04, four processes' critical sections overlapping by up
# to 2.0 s because `release()` deleted whatever file was at the path. A kernel
# lock has no stale state at all: when the holder dies, however it dies, the
# handle closes and the lock is gone.
#
# Wired at the top of `api.main()` (`store.claim_data_root()`), which refuses
# startup with a wall when another process holds the root. The mechanism is
# tested end to end in real subprocesses by `test_compaction.py` (section
# "xproc · the owner claim"). ⚠ Tests and drills that spawn their own backend
# must use an isolated ORGTREE_DATA — they already do, and now it is enforced.

# ---------------------------------------------------- external peer sightings
# D-166. `@mcp:` is a PULL transport: a peer is visible ONLY when it reaches
# in — a poll, a wait, or a send. Nothing else on this machine knows whether
# one is alive, which is why a response handle attached for a peer that later
# died used to sit in an agent's system prompt for good, with the prompt still
# telling the agent to answer there. This file IS that missing signal; it
# exists for no other purpose.
#
# MACHINE-GLOBAL, not per-org, for three reasons: peer identity is
# machine-level (`~/.orgtree/extern-id`), one peer talks to several orgs at
# once, and `_extern_scan` already sweeps every org for it. Per-org would also
# mean taking DOC_LOCK on every 25-second poll of every listener.
#
# This file holds EVIDENCE ONLY — one `last_seen` per peer, meaning "it
# reached in at this time". It deliberately does NOT hold when a handle was
# attached: that is a fact about a NODE, it lives on the node
# (`external_handles_at`), and keeping it here could not distinguish a handle
# that had sat unused for a week from one re-attached a second ago.

# a peer nobody has bound a handle to and nobody has heard from in this long
# is just clutter; pruned on write so the file cannot grow without bound
