"""The credit ledger: nodes, the budget invariant, and the seven operations.

Semantics ratified in PLAN.md (all §-references point there):

    free(N) = grant(N) - SUM over live children C of ( seat_cost(C) + grant(C) )   >= 0

The user IS the org root (§7.4): there is no root node. Top-level nodes have parent None,
and the reserved actor id "user" has infinite free and unconditional authority.

Credits are occupancy, not spend (§3.4). A credit is not a dollar.

Stranding (§4.4, corrected during implementation): a warning fires whenever an operation
REDUCES a node's free across an archived dependent's rehire cost. Promote/demote leave every
free unchanged (the release and acquire paths cancel hop by hop), so moves cannot strand —
the ops that can are hire (the payer), forcible hire (the actor), rehire (the parent, for its
other archived children), reallocate(-Δ), and switch_model to a pricier tier (the chain).

Directory access (№30) is an inherited capability set, NOT a budget: a node may hold only
dirs its parent holds (top-level nodes are user-granted and unconstrained). Nothing conserves;
revoke is explicit; re-parenting intersects the moved subtree's dirs with the new chain.

        # announces itself to the same parties. Announcing from a load hook
        # is safe for the same reason the release is: the TRIGGER (the
        # lock) is consumed in the same mutation, so once any save persists
        # this copy no later load re-announces, and unsaved copies die with
        # their load and re-derive identically — every reader sees exactly
        # one announcement. (Redteam-measured 2026-08-06: five unsaved
        # reads move nothing on disk; the first save persists exactly one
        # copy; later save cycles add nothing.)
        # ※ An unsaved reader's release being INVISIBLE on disk is the
        # property that makes this safe, not a bug — do NOT "fix" it by
        # saving from this hook, which would turn every read into a write.
        # STUCK-1 (user report 2026-08-06: already-halted fable agents could
        # not be unfrozen — the d40dd82 fix was forward-only). A TIMELESS

        # takes the 300 s probe floor BEFORE fable_limit_hit runs), so no
        # new lock can be timeless — and most on-disk timeless locks were
        # written by the misread itself (a session limit recorded as weekly
        # exhaustion). Release them rather than back-date: back-dating keeps
        # agents halted for a limit that was never hit.

        by construction — it lands to be read at leisure and never wakes
        anyone — so it never had business claiming unread status. Rather than
        teaching every unread count to skip notices, they simply never enter

        goes straight to the archive and is read on arrival by construction.

        ⚠ WHY AT THE SOURCE RATHER THAN IN THE COUNTS. Six places derive "how
        much is unread" — tree()'s `user_inbox_count` and `urgent_unread`, the
        tab title, `attentionPip`, the folder tab's badge and the mark-all-read
        button — and every one of them reads membership of this one list. A
        filter added to the counts would have to be added to all six and stay
        agreed forever; keeping notices out of the list fixes all six at once
        and leaves nothing to keep in step. (This is the same reasoning as the
        D-169 pip classifier, applied one layer further down: fix the fact,

        limit exhausted, agents halted or dissolved — and those are exactly
        the mail a user must not have silently pre-read. Getting this

        notice box, which is keyed by seat. So a cheap-compacted or re-seeded
        agent's very first turn opened with the whole undelivered backlog of
        its predecessor — measured on resonite/coordinator: 22 notices, 7,082
        chars, spanning three days, 11 of them the same "the user gave a
        direct instruction to X" line, 9 of those about a report that had
        been retired before the block was ever delivered.

        A notice is a DIFF. A session with no memory has no baseline to apply
        one to — and the facts worth having are already true in front of it:
        `_render_chart` puts the CURRENT org chart in the system prompt every
        turn, so "your report X was retired" is a restatement, while "re-check
        any plan of yours that depends on it" is unactionable when there is no
        plan. Paying ~2k tokens of stale diff at the top of the context you
        compacted to make cheap is exactly backwards.

        So the backlog is DIGESTED, not dropped (user ruling 2026-08-20):
        notices of the same kind collapse to their newest, with the count of
        what folded into it. Nothing is destroyed — `notice_log` keeps every
        entry and /nodes/{nid}/history renders them per node.

        Returns the number of notices folded away (0 = box left verbatim).
        Deliberately NOT called by `compact_split`: a normal compaction's
        successor carries the CLI's own summary, so its "since your last

        retire()'s own path unmodified (auto-dissolve on live reports); the
        new mutation is `parent.grant -= stake` afterwards, which nets the
        parent's headroom to exactly where it was before the hire ever
        happened — versus a plain retire's +stake. That freed-headroom
        recompute is what makes retired seats rehireable, and defeating it is
        the point: a rehire now needs NEW capacity from above, not the
        remains of the rescinded seat.

        USER-ONLY (ruling 2026-08-11, mirroring delete()): the claw-back
        lands on a THIRD party — the superior — which is no agent's to
        invoke. Deliberately NO mcptool verb exists for this.

        Arithmetic safety: while the child is live, committed(parent) ≥ stake
        (that is what funded it), so grant ≥ stake and free ends exactly
        where it started. The min() below extends totality to the
        already-archived case, where a reallocate may have moved the freed
        headroom since: the claw-back takes what is reclaimable and says so,
        and never pushes free(parent) negative.

        ⚠ Cascaded hires need no chain walk: _chain_acquire inflates the
        IMMEDIATE parent's own grant when a hire bubbles, so the parent's
        stored grant always fully reflects this child's stake. Residual

        2026-08-12 to compact_split's in-place shape): replace a cold, heavy
        SESSION, never the seat.

        Why it exists: /compact resumes the prior CLI session, reloading the
        full transcript as input — idle past the cache TTL that reload pays
        near-full input price. This resets the session instead: the seat
        keeps its id, parent, scope, charter, grant and TEAM; only
        `session_id` is replaced (fresh id ⇒ the next turn starts empty), so
        the successor pays only for the history it actively chooses to read
        (docs/cache-economics.md has the arithmetic).

        The pre-compact session archives IN PLACE as a knowledge bearer
        `nid@gen` — compact_split's exact lineage shape (0 credits, tools
        stripped, successor backlink, rehireable as the node's own
        subordinate). The one difference from a CLI compaction: the
        successor starts EMPTY rather than with a summary, and its notice
        says so.

        Was. (shipped 2ca1a14, reworked before ever deployed to a live org):
        retire + fresh hire under a suffixed name (`nid-2`) — which broke
        addressing (every peer mailing the old name deferred into an
        archived mailbox) and orphaned teams (a live-reports refusal). The
        in-place shape has neither problem, so BOTH are gone: reports keep
        their superior, correspondents keep their address.

        The seat's open request batch is MOOTED: the successor session never
        asked, and an answer arriving to it would read as someone else's
        mail (same reasoning as retire's mooting)."""

        """FR-18 (user request 2026-08-07, rulings 2026-08-12): a PET — a
        persistent watcher that mails its owner when its target produces a
        matching event. Free by ruling (never enters TIERS), bounded
        numerically. Kinds:
          file     poll a path; new content matching `pattern` fires (the
                   high-water diff also recovers events from orgtree's OWN
                   downtime — the FR-07-spool property, for files)
          command  run a command each interval; matching output fires
          process  liveness — `pid:N` or `port:N`; fires on the DOWN edge
          stream   a persistent LISTENING command: each matching stdout line
                   surfaces the moment it occurs (user ruling: the realtime
                   alternative to a cadence); dies with orgtree, re-armed by
                   the engine at startup — downtime output is honestly lost
        Capability rule (ruling): a dog runs with its OWNER's hands —
        command/stream require the owner to hold bash and run inside the
        owner's sandbox when sandboxed; file paths are containment-checked
        at the API boundary against the owner's readable roots.

        `notice=True` (user ruling 2026-08-21) makes the fire PASSIVE: the
        mail lands in the owner's box exactly as before, but no turn is
        STARTED for it — the same bargain orgtree_send_notice strikes, and
        it reuses that mechanism (`send_message(..., wake=False)`), so a
        RUNNING owner is still steered mid-task and only an IDLE one is left
        alone. Default stays waking: every dog armed before this existed,
        and every dog armed without the flag, drives a turn as it always
        has. The flag is for "tell me the build finished" — worth knowing,
        not worth a turn.

        `shell` (2026-08-22) opts a command/stream dog out of the platform's
        native shell. ABSENT — and every dog armed before this existed is
        absent — means native, i.e. `shell=True`: cmd.exe on a Windows host,
        exactly as before. "bash" runs `bash -lc` instead, for agents who
        want the POSIX idiom the old tool card wrongly implied they had.

        ⚠ The API boundary REFUSES "bash" when no bash can be found, rather
        than falling back (see api.py). Falling back would rebuild the defect
        this field exists to fix, one level up: the agent asks for bash, is
        given cmd, writes bash, and the dog matches nothing forever — this
        time with the tool having agreed that bash was fine."""

        APPEND-ONLY — boundary, summary, then the later turns, all in one file

        was missing was a session id that RESOLVED to the pre-compaction self:
        this method left the predecessor sharing the successor's id, and
        resuming that replays the successor's own post-compaction state. The
        generation was written off as unconsultable while every record of it
        sat on disk (measured on ingame-prompt@6: 428 surviving lines).

        (bearer_state="lost": visible in the lineage stack, honestly
        unconsultable). That is the deliberate FAIL-SOFT: if the pre-
